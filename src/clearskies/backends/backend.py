        Pass in a model or model class, and it returns a (possibly poorly constructed) model

        The backends have some methods mainly meant for testing which accept either a model
        or model class.  We accept the model class because, especially when testing, this is often much easier
        to provide (since you need a columns object to build the model).  In all current cases, these backend
        methods don't actually need a full model - just the table name.  This is quite simple when we have a model,
        because the model can tell you what the table name is.

        It's tricky when we get a model class because that means we need to build the model, but we don't
        have access to a generic model builder.  We could ask the dev to provide a model, but being able to provide just
        a model class will save devs a lot trouble in many cases (especially testing).

        Fortunately, pulling out a table name for the model basically never involves dependencies.  Therefore,
        we will cheat!  We'll just inject gibberish for the arguments of the constructor and hope nothing
        breaks.

        NOTE: If you're here because something broke, and your dependencies actually do matter for determining
        the table name, then you need to do two things:

         1. Consider if you're doing something the wrong way, because that is weird
         2. Just provide the model instead of the model class.

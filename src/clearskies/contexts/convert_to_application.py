    Converts a variety of allowed inputs into an application which the context can run.

    This is called by the `build_context` method which is in turn used by all of the
    clearskies.context.* functions.  The goal is to provide flexibility to the developer.
    The context itself always runs an application.  However, we want to give the developer
    additional options.  This function marrys the two.  This function can specifically handle:

     1. A module
     2. A function
     3. A function with one or more clearskies.decorators.* applied to it
     4. A list containing any number of the above
     5. A clearskies.Application object
     6. A dictionary containing two keys: 'handler_class' and 'handler_config'

    Note that if more than one function is provided they will all be wrapped in a SimpleRouting
    handler.  In addition, if any of the functions don't have routing information provided
    by a decorator, then the the function name will be used as the route for the function
    and only the GET method will be allowed.

    Finally, if passing in a module, note that only functions with routing decorators will be
    imported.  This stops you from accidentally taking helper functions and exposing them as endpoints.
